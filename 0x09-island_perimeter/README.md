Define a function island_perimeter(grid): that computes the perimeter of an island depicted in a 2D grid. In this grid, 0 represents water and 1 represents land, with each cell being a square with a side length of 1. Cells are connected either horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. The grid is rectangular with dimensions not exceeding 100 in width or height. It is entirely surrounded by water, contains only one island, and has no internal lakes (water that isn't connected to the surrounding water).

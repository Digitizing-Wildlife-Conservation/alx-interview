                                         0x0A. Prime Game Algorithm Python Cohort 

This project involves creating a Python algorithm to determine the winner of a game where players take turns removing prime numbers and their multiples from a set of integers. Using concepts like prime numbers (via Sieve of Eratosthenes), game theory, and dynamic programming, you will implement the function def isWinner(x, nums) to decide the winner over multiple rounds. Adhere to PEP 8 style, ensure all files are executable, and include a README.md file. The project resides in the GitHub repository alx-interview under the directory 0x0A-primegame.

  0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix Algorithm Python Cohort


The Rotate 2D Matrix project, part of an interview coding challenge, involves creating a function, rotate_2d_matrix(matrix), which rotates an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise. Implemented in 0-rotate_2d_matrix.py, this function modifies the matrix in-place and assumes the matrix is non-empty and 2-dimensional.

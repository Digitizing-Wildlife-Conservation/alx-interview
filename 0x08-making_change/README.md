0x08. Making Change Algorithm Python 66 percent below threshold recovery Resolved merge conflict in README.md Cohort

This project involves interview coding challenges, specifically focusing on creating a module with a function to determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount, total, using a list of coin values. The function prototype is def makeChange(coins, total). It returns the minimum number of coins required to meet total, or 0 if total is 0 or less, and -1 if the total cannot be met with the given coins. The coin values are positive integers, and an infinite number of each coin denomination is assumed. The solution's runtime will also be evaluated.

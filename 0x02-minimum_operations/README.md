 0x02. Minimum Operations Algorithm Python Cohort

Moses Muchai Lead Software Engineer ALX SE Software Engineering @ Holberton Master Card Foundation

The README presents a project focusing on interview coding challenges, particularly addressing the "Minimum Operations" task. This task involves manipulating a text file containing a single character 'H' using only two operations: Copy All and Paste, to achieve a specific number of occurrences of 'H'. The script 0-minoperations.py provides a method minOperations(n) to calculate the minimum number of operations needed for this task, returning 0 if the desired number of occurrences is impossible to achieve.

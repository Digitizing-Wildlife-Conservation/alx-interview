 -0x05. N Queens Algorithm Python Cohort-

This project features an interview coding challenge focused on solving the N Queens puzzle, where N non-attacking queens must be placed on an NxN chessboard. The provided script, 0-nqueens.py, takes an integer N (â‰¥ 4) as input and prints all possible solutions, each on a new line. The program validates input, ensuring N is an integer greater than or equal to 4, and only imports the sys module. If incorrect arguments are provided, it outputs appropriate error messages and exits with status 1.

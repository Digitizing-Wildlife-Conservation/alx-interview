0x04. UTF-8 Validation Algorithm Python Cohort

This project involves coding challenges typically used in interviews. The main task is UTF-8 validation, implemented in the script 0-stats.py. The function validUTF8(data) checks if a data set, represented as a list of integers where each integer corresponds to a byte, is a valid UTF-8 encoding. The function returns True if the encoding is valid and False otherwise. UTF-8 characters can be between 1 to 4 bytes long, and the validation only considers the 8 least significant bits of each integer in the data set.

                                                                      -Happy Coding-
